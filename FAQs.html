    <div class="faq-section">
      <!-- FAQ 1 -->
      <div class="faq">
        <h3>1. What is the process for booking a hotel room online?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Booking a hotel room online is a quick and convenient process. Begin by selecting your travel dates and destination to view available hotels. Once you’ve found a suitable option, click to see detailed information about the room types, amenities, and guest reviews. After choosing your room, proceed with the booking by entering personal details, choosing add-ons (like breakfast), and making a payment. Most platforms offer secure payment gateways and immediate confirmation, so you can book confidently from the comfort of your home.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <!-- FAQ 2 -->
      <div class="faq">
        <h3>2. How do I know if the hotel has the amenities I need?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Most booking platforms provide a detailed list of amenities for each hotel. Look for symbols or descriptions indicating services such as Wi-Fi, parking, room service, spa, pool, or gym. Additionally, you can check reviews from previous guests to learn more about their experience. Some platforms allow you to filter hotels based on specific amenities, making it easier to find exactly what you’re looking for.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- FAQ 3 -->
      <div class="faq">
        <h3>3. What payment options are available when booking a hotel online?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Most online booking platforms accept a variety of payment methods, including major credit and debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express), digital wallets (PayPal, Google Pay, Apple Pay), and sometimes even bank transfers. If you're booking through an international platform, they may also accept foreign currency or offer currency conversion options. Always check for secure payment symbols, as reputable platforms use encryption to protect your financial information.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- FAQ 4 -->
      <div class="faq">
        <h3>4. Can I cancel my reservation if my plans change?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Most hotels offer flexible cancellation policies, but it’s essential to read the cancellation terms carefully. Free cancellation is often available up to a certain date before your stay, while last-minute cancellations may incur fees. Look for “Flexible” or “Refundable” tags on booking platforms, or review the hotel’s specific terms under the booking details. If you need assistance, customer support can help you navigate the cancellation process.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- FAQ 5 -->
      <div class="faq">
        <h3>5. How do I receive my booking confirmation?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>After completing your booking, you’ll receive a confirmation email within minutes. This email will contain essential details such as your reservation number, hotel address, check-in time, and any policies regarding check-in requirements. Some platforms also allow you to view or manage your bookings via a user account or app, giving you easy access to your booking information at any time.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- FAQ 6 -->
      <div class="faq">
        <h3>6. Can I request early check-in or late check-out?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Yes, most hotels offer flexibility with check-in and check-out times, but it’s best to contact the hotel in advance to confirm availability. Early check-in and late check-out may be subject to additional charges or depend on room availability. Some hotels provide this service as a courtesy, especially if you're a member of their loyalty program, so be sure to mention any membership benefits you may have.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- FAQ 7 -->
      <div class="faq">
        <h3>7. What should I do if I have a special request, like an accessible room?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Special requests, such as accessible rooms or specific bed arrangements, can often be made during the booking process. Most booking platforms have a field for additional requests, which will be sent directly to the hotel. However, it's a good idea to follow up with the hotel directly to ensure they can accommodate your needs, especially during peak travel seasons.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- FAQ 8 -->
      <div class="faq">
        <h3>8. Are taxes and service fees included in the displayed price?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>This depends on the booking platform and country of booking. Some platforms display the full price, including taxes and fees, while others may add these at checkout. Always review the total price before confirming to avoid surprises. Additionally, hotels may charge extra for incidentals like minibar use or room service during your stay, so inquire with the hotel if you need clarification.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- FAQ 9 -->
      <div class="faq">
        <h3>9. Can I earn points with my hotel loyalty program when booking online?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>If you book through the hotel’s official website or app, your stay should be eligible for loyalty points. Many major hotel chains also offer partnerships with third-party booking platforms, allowing you to earn points even when booking elsewhere. Be sure to enter your loyalty number at booking or present it at check-in to ensure you receive credit for your stay.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- FAQ 10 -->
      <div class="faq">
        <h3>10. What should I do if there’s an issue with my booking upon arrival?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>If you encounter any issues upon arrival, such as a missing reservation or incorrect room assignment, first check your confirmation details and booking ID.

They often have dedicated teams to resolve any on-site issues swiftly, ensuring your stay is smooth and enjoyable.</p>
